# Virtual_Pet_Simulator_Project
Hello everyone!!
Today I am going to create a Virtual Pet Simulator Project.
So I will continue this project in C#. 
In this, we will allow user to enter the pet type and pet name.For getting that we will simply use Readline and Writeline commands.
Once we get pet name and type we will move forward to next step.
So, we will perform actions such as feed, play and rest on the pet and it will effect it's health, happiness, or hunger respectively.
For that we will just make a class named Program in which we will do all our coding part to handle everything.

Firsly, we will make a class named pet in which we will define all the variables that we need to follow for the pet's activity such as FEED, PLAY and all.
By default we will set all the things on level 5
And as the actions are performed it will increase or decrease respectively.
We will call the functions using while loop and switch cases and it will perform the tasks as per the functions.
